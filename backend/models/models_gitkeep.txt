# This file ensures the models/ directory is tracked by git
# Add your trained models here:
# - eye_classifier.pth (eye drowsiness classifier)
# - drowsiness_mobilenetv2.pth (if using MobileNet approach)
#
# Models are excluded from git via .gitignore to avoid large file commits
# Consider using Git LFS for model versioning, or store models externally
